// react router is a way to add a custom link on a websites as react create a single page application so if we want to get a particular page link then we will use react router

// npm install react-router-dom 


//Now after creating the header and footer compnents we have to make it on a same page so


function App() {
  return (
    <>

    <Header />
    <Footer />
    <Home />

    like This we cannot execute in here because my components contains router also so for that we have to execute it in main.jsx file
