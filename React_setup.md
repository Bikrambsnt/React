# React setup 

# cmd 
 
 #### step one 
 open Terminal 

 add this cmd on it

  npm create-react-app <folder name>
  example npm create-react-app Basic one 

  Remember that this is a large package so it will take some time to install

# Packages

After installation we got lots of file from there we get package.json

package.json is the entry level file 

first we will see the name of the file.
second there is version 



# Run react on Browser

npm run start

# Build cmd
npm run build 

build folder is created to deploy the react on production
it will wrap all the js code in a single folder





++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The above method will take long time to install so we will use vite

go to vite site 

#### cmd 

npm create vite@latest

after that it will ask for folder name add name and follow the process


#### run
npm run dev



More notes each  folders 

Happy Coding
