## Blog web App

In this I have created a mega project with react in which I can do create, read , update and delete , in this I have used backend also in to store the login data and uploaded post data.


## what I have used 

#### appwrite

A open source platform for database where we can store our web app data

#### tinymce

A open source text editor which provide lots of fonts and designs

#### React Hook forms 

Its a library from react to handle forms

#### Html React parser

This is because when we save the data on the appwrite on that time it will get saved in html form in tags so in our view we need  a simple text so to convert that...

#### Thats what I am going to use on this project.........


Lets Build this ....///
